Interpreting User Needs

I interpret user needs and implement them into a program by focusing on user stories. User stories help translate client expectations into clear, actionable requirements that developers can understand and prioritize. They describe the functionality from the end user’s perspective, ensuring that what we build directly addresses the client’s needs. By breaking the project into these smaller stories, it becomes easier to organize the workflow, plan the sprint, and implement features step by step while keeping the client’s vision at the center.

Approaching Program Development

There are many ways to approach program development, but the Agile methodology has proven to be one of the most effective. Agile allows development to be flexible, iterative, and responsive to change. Through regular planning, sprint reviews, and continuous feedback, the process becomes smoother and ensures higher-quality outcomes. In my future work, I hope to incorporate Agile values such as iterative planning, regular feedback, and incremental delivery so that I can consistently deliver a product that meets both user expectations and technical standards.

Being a Good Team Member

Being a good team member in software development means more than just completing assigned tasks—it requires collaboration, accountability, and respect for the process. In an Agile setting, this includes participating actively in Scrum events, communicating clearly with the team, and adapting to feedback. A good team member also supports others when challenges arise and stays committed to the shared goals of the project. Strong teamwork ensures that the project moves forward efficiently and that the final product reflects everyone’s contributions.
